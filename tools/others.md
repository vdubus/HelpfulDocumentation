## [Acrylic DNS Proxy](http://mayakron.altervista.org)

A tool available for windows allowing some performance improvement on DNS caching, and allowing wildcards and regex in the host definition.

Don't forget to enable **Acrylic** once, it's installed! Just follow the [windows 10 guide](http://mayakron.altervista.org/wikibase/show.php?id=AcrylicWindows10Configuration) to do so. Other guides are available on the [Home page](http://mayakron.altervista.org).

To add new host, simply edit the file named `AcrylicHosts.txt`. Then, once it's done, restart the service.
