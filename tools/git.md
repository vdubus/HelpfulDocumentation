# Git

## Installation

To begin with, we would need first to install
[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).

## Integration

### PowerShell Integration with [Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git)

We can integrate Git inside of **PowerShell** with **Posh-Git**.  
To do so, and for complete integration, we shoud open the **PowerShell**
console as an admin and execute this command to install **Posh-Git**:

```
PowerShellGet\Install-Module posh-git
```

Then, to enable it so that each time you open the console it is available, do:

```
Add-PoshGitToProfile
```

You will find more information on
[Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) website.
