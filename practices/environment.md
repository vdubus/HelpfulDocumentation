# Environment

## Development

A good method to create our development environment is to have a specific repository in which we will put our applications and others tools specific to the development.
This repository should be accessible from all users on the computer in the case than one of our teammate would need to access it.

Example: `C:\development`

That's only if you don't need this to be secured and only accessible for you only. But for such a critical project, the best would be to create a virtual secured disk to be mount only when working on it. To do so, I would sugest to use [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/).
